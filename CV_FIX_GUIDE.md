# Fixing the Empty CV Download Issue

The current CV file in your website is just a placeholder with the text "[CV content would be here]" and is only 28 bytes in size. This is why the CV download button is downloading an empty PDF. Follow these steps to fix this issue:

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Locate the Current Placeholder Files**:
   - The placeholder CV is located in two places:
     - `static-site/assets/abdallah-abdelmajeed-cv.pdf`
     - `public/abdallah-abdelmajeed-cv.pdf`

2. **Create or Prepare Your Actual CV**:
   - Create your CV in PDF format
   - Make sure it contains your complete and up-to-date information
   - Ensure the file is properly formatted and readable

3. **Replace the Placeholder Files**:
   - Replace `static-site/assets/abdallah-abdelmajeed-cv.pdf` with your actual CV
   - Also replace `public/abdallah-abdelmajeed-cv.pdf` with the same file
   - Make sure to keep the same filename to maintain all existing links

4. **Verify the File Size**:
   - Check that the new PDF file size is appropriate (typically at least several hundred KB)
   - A file size of only a few bytes indicates the file might still be empty or corrupted

5. **Test the Download**:
   - Open your website locally or after deployment
   - Click on the CV download button
   - Verify that the correct and complete CV is downloaded

## Important Notes

- If you're setting up the root domain GitHub Pages site as described in ROOT_DOMAIN_SETUP.md, make sure to copy your actual CV to the new repository
- Keep your CV updated regularly to reflect your latest achievements and experience
- Consider having both a detailed full CV and a condensed resume version for different purposes
